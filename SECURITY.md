## Supported Versions

I am currently using Hugo v0.98.0-165d299cde259c8b801abadc6d3405a229e449f6+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2022-04-28T10:23:30Z VendorInfo=gohugoio to complete the static build of the repo. :zap:

The GitHub Actions YML file, .github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-witty-grass-042828710.yml, that is published to a static web app on Azure is set to `HUGO_VERSION: "0.90.1".`

It is built with `Visual Studio Code - Insiders Version: 1.68.0-insider. Commit: 87630a9122f88f5062fe9964839a92116c274a86` Like we all do, I keep my VS Code client up to date. So...it has likely already changed. ðŸ˜Š

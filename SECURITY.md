## Supported Versions

I am currently using `hugo v0.110.0-e32a493b7826d02763c3b79623952e625402b168+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2023-01-17T12:16:09Z VendorInfo=gohugoio` to complete the static build of the repo. :zap:

The GitHub Actions YML file, .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml, that is published to a static web app on Azure that is set to utilize `HUGO_VERSION: "0.90.1".`

It is built with `Visual Studio Code - Insiders Version: 1.68.0-insider. Commit: 87630a9122f88f5062fe9964839a92116c274a86` Like we all do, I keep my VS Code client up to date. So...it has likely already changed. ðŸ˜Š

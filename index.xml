[5] For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. [6] Whatever the LORD pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps. [7] He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth, who makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind from his storehouses.</description></item></channel></rss>

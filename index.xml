[16] For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. [17] For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.” Today's Memory Verse 1 John 4:7-8 - Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.</description></item></channel></rss>

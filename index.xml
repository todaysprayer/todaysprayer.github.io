[9] So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. [10] For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. Today's Memory Verse 1 John 4:7-8 - Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.</description></item></channel></rss>

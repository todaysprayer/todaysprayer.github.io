[1] Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, you are very great! You are clothed with splendor and majesty, [2] covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent. Today's Memory Verse Matthew 11:28-30 - Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</description></item></channel></rss>

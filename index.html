but walk in his ways!

in which you have made me hope.
[50] This is my comfort in my affliction,
that your promise gives me life.
[51] The insolent utterly deride me,
but I do not turn away from your law.
[52] When I think of your rules from of old,
I take comfort, O LORD.
[53] Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked,
who forsake your law.
[54] Your statutes have been my songs
in the house of my sojourning.
[55] I remember your name in the night, O LORD,
and keep your law.
[56] This blessing has fallen to me,
that I have kept your precepts.
Heth
[57] The LORD is my portion;
I promise to keep your words.
[58] I entreat your favor with all my heart;
be gracious to me according to your promise.
[59] When I think on my ways,
I turn my feet to your testimonies;
[60] I hasten and do not delay
to keep your commandments.
[61] Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me,
I do not forget your law.
[62] At midnight I rise to praise you,
because of your righteous rules.
[63] I am a companion of all who fear you,
of those who keep your precepts.
[64] The earth, O LORD, is full of your steadfast love;
teach me your statutes!
Teth
[65] You have dealt well with your servant,
O LORD, according to your word.
[66] Teach me good judgment and knowledge,
for I believe in your commandments.
[67] Before I was afflicted I went astray,
but now I keep your word.
[68] You are good and do good;
teach me your statutes.
[69] The insolent smear me with lies,
but with my whole heart I keep your precepts;
[70] their heart is unfeeling like fat,
but I delight in your law.
[71] It is good for me that I was afflicted,
that I might learn your statutes.
[72] The law of your mouth is better to me
than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
Yodh
[73] Your hands have made and fashioned me;
give me understanding that I may learn your commandments.
[74] Those who fear you shall see me and rejoice,
because I have hoped in your word.
[75] I know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous,
and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
[76] Let your steadfast love comfort me
according to your promise to your servant.
[77] Let your mercy come to me, that I may live;
for your law is my delight.
[78] Let the insolent be put to shame,
because they have wronged me with falsehood;
as for me, I will meditate on your precepts.
[79] Let those who fear you turn to me,
that they may know your testimonies.
[80] May my heart be blameless in your statutes,
that I may not be put to shame!
Kaph
[81] My soul longs for your salvation;
I hope in your word.
[82] My eyes long for your promise;
I ask, “When will you comfort me?”
[83] For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke,
yet I have not forgotten your statutes.
[84] How long must your servant endure?
When will you judge those who persecute me?
[85] The insolent have dug pitfalls for me;
they do not live according to your law.
[86] All your commandments are sure;
they persecute me with falsehood; help me!
[87] They have almost made an end of me on earth,
but I have not forsaken your precepts.
[88] In your steadfast love give me life,
that I may keep the testimonies of your mouth.
Lamedh
[89] Forever, O LORD, your word
is firmly fixed in the heavens.
[90] Your faithfulness endures to all generations;
you have established the earth, and it stands fast.
[91] By your appointment they stand this day,
for all things are your servants.
[92] If your law had not been my delight,
I would have perished in my affliction.
[93] I will never forget your precepts,
for by them you have given me life.
[94] I am yours; save me,
for I have sought your precepts.
[95] The wicked lie in wait to destroy me,
but I consider your testimonies.
[96] I have seen a limit to all perfection,
but your commandment is exceedingly broad.
Mem
[97] Oh how I love your law!
It is my meditation all the day.
[98] Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies,
for it is ever with me.
[99] I have more understanding than all my teachers,
for your testimonies are my meditation.
[100] I understand more than the aged,
for I keep your precepts.
[101] I hold back my feet from every evil way,
in order to keep your word.
[102] I do not turn aside from your rules,
for you have taught me.
[103] How sweet are your words to my taste,
sweeter than honey to my mouth!
[104] Through your precepts I get understanding;
therefore I hate every false way.
Nun
[105] Your word is a lamp to my feet
and a light to my path.
[106] I have sworn an oath and confirmed it,
to keep your righteous rules.
[107] I am severely afflicted;
give me life, O LORD, according to your word!
[108] Accept my freewill offerings of praise, O LORD,
and teach me your rules.
[109] I hold my life in my hand continually,
but I do not forget your law.
[110] The wicked have laid a snare for me,
but I do not stray from your precepts.
[111] Your testimonies are my heritage forever,
for they are the joy of my heart.
[112] I incline my heart to perform your statutes
forever, to the end.
Samekh
[113] I hate the double-minded,
but I love your law.
[114] You are my hiding place and my shield;
I hope in your word.
[115] Depart from me, you evildoers,
that I may keep the commandments of my God.
[116] Uphold me according to your promise, that I may live,
and let me not be put to shame in my hope!
[117] Hold me up, that I may be safe
and have regard for your statutes continually!
[118] You spurn all who go astray from your statutes,
for their cunning is in vain.
[119] All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross,
therefore I love your testimonies.
[120] My flesh trembles for fear of you,
and I am afraid of your judgments.
Ayin
[121] I have done what is just and right;
do not leave me to my oppressors.
[122] Give your servant a pledge of good;
let not the insolent oppress me.
[123] My eyes long for your salvation
and for the fulfillment of your righteous promise.
[124] Deal with your servant according to your steadfast love,
and teach me your statutes.
[125] I am your servant; give me understanding,
that I may know your testimonies!
[126] It is time for the LORD to act,
for your law has been broken.
[127] Therefore I love your commandments
above gold, above fine gold.
[128] Therefore I consider all your precepts to be right;
I hate every false way.
Pe
[129] Your testimonies are wonderful;
therefore my soul keeps them.
[130] The unfolding of your words gives light;
it imparts understanding to the simple.
[131] I open my mouth and pant,
because I long for your commandments.
[132] Turn to me and be gracious to me,
as is your way with those who love your name.
[133] Keep steady my steps according to your promise,
and let no iniquity get dominion over me.
[134] Redeem me from man’s oppression,
that I may keep your precepts.
[135] Make your face shine upon your servant,
and teach me your statutes.
[136] My eyes shed streams of tears,
because people do not keep your law.
Tsadhe
[137] Righteous are you, O LORD,
and right are your rules.
[138] You have appointed your testimonies in righteousness
and in all faithfulness.
[139] My zeal consumes me,
because my foes forget your words.
[140] Your promise is well tried,
and your servant loves it.
[141] I am small and despised,
yet I do not forget your precepts.
[142] Your righteousness is righteous forever,
and your law is true.
[143] Trouble and anguish have found me out,
but your commandments are my delight.
[144] Your testimonies are righteous forever;
give me understanding that I may live.
Qoph
[145] With my whole heart I cry; answer me, O LORD!
I will keep your statutes.
[146] I call to you; save me,
that I may observe your testimonies.
[147] I rise before dawn and cry for help;
I hope in your words.
[148] My eyes are awake before the watches of the night,
that I may meditate on your promise.
[149] Hear my voice according to your steadfast love;
O LORD, according to your justice give me life.
[150] They draw near who persecute me with evil purpose;
they are far from your law.
[151] But you are near, O LORD,
and all your commandments are true.
[152] Long have I known from your testimonies
that you have founded them forever.
Resh
[153] Look on my affliction and deliver me,
for I do not forget your law.
[154] Plead my cause and redeem me;
give me life according to your promise!
[155] Salvation is far from the wicked,
for they do not seek your statutes.
[156] Great is your mercy, O LORD;
give me life according to your rules.
[157] Many are my persecutors and my adversaries,
but I do not swerve from your testimonies.
[158] I look at the faithless with disgust,
because they do not keep your commands.
[159] Consider how I love your precepts!
Give me life, O LORD, according to your steadfast love.
[160] The sum of your word is truth,
and every one of your righteous rules endures forever.
Sin and Shin
[161] Princes persecute me without cause,
but my heart stands in awe of your words.
[162] I rejoice at your word
like one who finds great spoil.
[163] I hate and abhor falsehood,
but I love your law.
[164] Seven times a day I praise you
for your righteous rules.
[165] Great peace have those who love your law;
nothing can make them stumble.
[166] I hope for your salvation, O LORD,
and I do your commandments.
[167] My soul keeps your testimonies;
I love them exceedingly.
[168] I keep your precepts and testimonies,
for all my ways are before you.
Taw
[169] Let my cry come before you, O LORD;
give me understanding according to your word!
[170] Let my plea come before you;
deliver me according to your word.
[171] My lips will pour forth praise,
for you teach me your statutes.
[172] My tongue will sing of your word,
for all your commandments are right.
[173] Let your hand be ready to help me,
for I have chosen your precepts.
[174] I long for your salvation, O LORD,
and your law is my delight.
[175] Let my soul live and praise you,
and let your rules help me.
[176] I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant,
for I do not forget your commandments.</div><script>function showSelectedPrayer(e){e!="Select Prayer Category"?$("#selectedPrayer").text(e):$("#selectedPrayer").text("Select a Prayer Category")}Number.prototype.toHHMMSS=function(){var s=parseInt(this,10),e=Math.floor(s/3600),t=Math.floor((s-e*3600)/60),n=s-e*3600-t*60;return e<10&&(e=""+e),t<10&&(t=""+t),n<10&&(n="0"+n),e>0?e+":"+t+":"+n:t+":"+n};var timer=0;function showCount(){timer--,timer>=0&&(document.getElementById("prayerTimer").innerHTML="Time to Pray: "+timer.toHHMMSS(),setTimeout(showCount,1e3))}function startTimer(){var e=document.querySelector('input[name="minutesToPray"]:checked').value;timer=60*e,showCount()}function clearTimer(){timer=0,document.getElementById("prayerTimer").innerHTML="Prayer Time (Minutes)";for(var t=document.getElementsByName("minutesToPray"),e=0;e<t.length;e++)t[e].checked=!1}</script></div></article></div></div></main><footer id=footer class=footer><div class=icon-links><a href=https://todaysprayer.github.io/index.xml rel="noopener alternate" type=application/rss+xml class=iconfont title=rss target=_blank><svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 1024 1024" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="30" height="30"><path d="M819.157333 1024C819.157333 574.592 449.408 204.8.0 204.8V0c561.706667.0 1024 462.293333 1024 1024H819.157333zM140.416 743.04a140.8 140.8.0 01140.501333 140.586667A140.928 140.928.0 01140.074667 1024C62.72 1024 0 961.109333.0 883.626667S62.933333 743.082667 140.416 743.04zM678.784 1024h-199.04c0-263.210667-216.533333-479.786667-479.744-479.786667v-199.04c372.352.0 678.784 306.517333 678.784 678.826667z"/></svg></a></div><div class=copyright><span class=power-by>Powered by <a class=hexo-link href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>
